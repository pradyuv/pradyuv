# Hi, I'm Pradyu 👋

> **Systems Engineer building at the intersection of performance and product.**

I am a soon-to-be graduating student of Software Engineering at **uOttawa** with a passion for the "under the hood" details of software—memory, concurrency, and architecture. I combine professional experience in embedded systems and enterprise automation with a personal drive to build complex audio engines from scratch.

## 🚀 What I'm Building

**Kairos (Audio Engine)**
* **The Goal:** Building a cross-platform audio analysis engine.
* **The Tech:** C++, Digital Signal Processing (DSP), Real-time systems.
* **The Challenge:** Processing complex audio signals with minimal latency.

**Used Car Price Deviation Detector**
* **The Goal:** A residual-based pricing system to detect under/over-valued vehicle listings.
* **The Tech:** Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Random Forest.
* [cite_start]**The Win:** Cleaned raw listings into a stable schema and implemented banded thresholds for clear interpretability[cite: 37, 38, 39].

## 🔧 The Toolbox

| Category | Technologies |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Languages** | [cite_start]**C** (Embedded), **C++**, Python, Java, SQL, C# [cite: 43] |
| **Systems & Testing** | [cite_start]Linux, Cmocka, Slash, Memory Management, Unit Testing [cite: 44, 45, 46] |
| **DevOps & Cloud** | [cite_start]Docker, Jenkins, Git, Azure, CI/CD [cite: 44] |

## 👨‍💻 Timeline & Impact

* **Now:** Software Engineer Intern at **Ciena (Global R&D)**.
    * *Focus:* Embedded C, Low-level debugging, Memory optimization.
    * [cite_start]*Impact:* Designed a low-level debug command to traverse cache tables and increased unit test line coverage by 2x using Cmocka[cite: 15, 17].

* **2024:** SE Intern at **Health Canada**.
    * *Focus:* Python Automation & SQL.
    * [cite_start]*Impact:* Automated report aggregation, reducing manual workload by **70%**[cite: 22].

* **2023:** SE Intern at **Field Effect Security**.
    * *Focus:* C# & Azure Functions.
    * [cite_start]*Impact:* Optimized data retrieval time by **25%** for internal client databases[cite: 29].

* **2023:** Infra Intern at **Ford Motor Company**.
    * *Focus:* CI/CD & Python Validation.
    * [cite_start]*Impact:* Improved build pipeline reliability by **20%** via Jenkins & Slash integration[cite: 34].

## 🥊 Out of Office
When I'm not debugging memory leaks, I am:
* 🎹 **Musician:** Playing piano and producing music.
* 🥋 **Athlete:** Training in combat sports.
* 📚 **Reader:** Philosophy and non-fiction.
